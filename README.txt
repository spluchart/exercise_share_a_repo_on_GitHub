Hello visitor!

This is an exercise to complete part 2 of the "manage your code with Git and GitHub" course on openclassrooms.

I will use this exercise to push lists of my favorites movies/series/books on this repository.

This README file represent my first attempt in:
creating the repository > cloning > changing the file content > committing > pushing

Hope it will be successful :)
